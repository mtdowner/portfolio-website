        you for stopping by! I hope you aren't lost and aren't looking for a real web developer. You'll only find the mediocre things I have developed for the web. But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.

        I study new topics in html and css. I take what I learn and build on top of what I already know by adding to my portfolio (what you're looking at right now) or building new projects. I do this so maybe one day I can grow up to be the person other people say, "Wow, I bet she studied new topics in html and css everyday."

    December 2022 | Present</p>
  
      <p class="experience">I am a student as well as the teacher. Despite limited resources, I put my teaching cap on and drew up a plan that would allow me to learn web development for free and correctly. Hours were spent researching credible, content-rich tutorials, interactive courses and games, web development blogs, bootcamps all over the world-basically everything I could get my poor hands and wallet on.</p>

      <p class="experience">They didn't offer me a job. I believed honesty was the best policy, so next time I'm telling you now that I am very good at web development and I definitely know JavaScript and Python!</p>
